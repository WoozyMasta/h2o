(conda-update) --force-reinstall  ::  
Ensure that any user-requested package for the current operation is uninstalled and reinstalled, even if that package already exists in the environment.

(conda-update) --freeze-installed --no-update-deps  ::  
Do not update or change already-installed dependencies.

(conda-update) --update-deps  ::  
Update dependencies.

(conda-update) -S --satisfied-skip-solve  ::  
Exit early and do not run the solver if the requested specs are satisfied. Also skips aggressive updates as configured by 'aggressive_update_packages'. Similar to the default behavior of 'pip install'.

(conda-update) --update-all --all  ::  
Update all installed packages in the environment.

(conda-update) --update-specs  ::  
Update based on provided specifications.

(conda-update) --copy  ::  
Install all packages using copies instead of hard- or soft-linking.

(conda-update) --clobber  ::  
Allow clobbering of overlapping file paths within packages, and suppress related warnings.

(conda-update) -C --use-index-cache  ::  
Use cache of channel index files, even if it has expired.

(conda-update) -k --insecure  ::  
Allow conda to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers. Equivalent to setting 'ssl_verify' to 'false'.

(conda-update) --offline  ::  
Offline mode. Don't connect to the Internet.

(conda-update) -d --dry-run  ::  
Only display what would have been done.

(conda-update) --json  ::  
Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda programmatically.

(conda-update) -q --quiet  ::  
Do not display progress bar.

(conda-update) -v --verbose  ::  
Can be used multiple times. Once for INFO, twice for DEBUG, three times for TRACE.

(conda-update) -y --yes  ::  
Do not ask for confirmation.

(conda-update) --download-only  ::  
Solve an environment and ensure package caches are populated, but exit prior to unlinking and linking packages into the prefix.

(conda-update) --show-channel-urls  ::  
Show channel urls. Overrides the value given by `conda config --show show_channel_urls`.




(conda-upgrade) -h --help  ::  
Show this help message and exit.

(conda-upgrade) --file  ::  FILE
Read package versions from the given file. Repeated file specifications can be passed (e.g. --file=file1 --file=file2).

(conda-upgrade) -n --name  ::  ENVIRONMENT
Name of environment.

(conda-upgrade) -p --prefix  ::  PATH
Full path to environment location (i.e. prefix).

(conda-upgrade) -c --channel  ::  CHANNEL
Additional channel to search for packages. These are URLs searched in the order they are given (including local directories using the 'file://' syntax or simply a path like '/home/conda/mychan' or '../mychan'). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda. You can also use any name and the .condarc channel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias is http://conda.anaconda.org/.

(conda-upgrade) --use-local  ::  
Use locally built packages. Identical to '-c local'.

(conda-upgrade) --override-channels  ::  
Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.

(conda-upgrade) --repodata-fn  ::  REPODATA_FNS
Specify name of repodata on remote server. Conda will try whatever you specify, but will ultimately fall back to repodata.json if your specs are not satisfiable with what you specify here. This is used to employ repodata that is reduced in time scope. You may pass this flag more than once. Leftmost entries are tried first, and the fallback to repodata.json is added for you automatically.

(conda-upgrade) --strict-channel-priority  ::  
Packages in lower priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name appears in a higher priority channel.

(conda-upgrade) --no-channel-priority  ::  
Package version takes precedence over channel priority. Overrides the value given by `conda config --show channel_priority`.

(conda-upgrade) --no-deps  ::  
Do not install, update, remove, or change dependencies. This WILL lead to broken environments and inconsistent behavior. Use at your own risk.

(conda-upgrade) --only-deps  ::  
Only install dependencies.

(conda-upgrade) --no-pin  ::  
Ignore pinned file.

(conda-upgrade) --force-reinstall  ::  
Ensure that any user-requested package for the current operation is uninstalled and reinstalled, even if that package already exists in the environment.

(conda-upgrade) --freeze-installed --no-update-deps  ::  
Do not update or change already-installed dependencies.

(conda-upgrade) --update-deps  ::  
Update dependencies.

(conda-upgrade) -S --satisfied-skip-solve  ::
